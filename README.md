## Introduction to Solidity

### What is Solidity?

Solidity is a statically-typed, contract-oriented programming language designed for implementing smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It was first proposed in 2014 by Gavin Wood and has since become the de facto standard for Ethereum smart contract development. Solidity is influenced by languages like C++, Python, and JavaScript, making it relatively approachable for developers with prior programming experience.

### Why Learn Solidity?

- **Decentralized Applications**: Solidity powers dApps, enabling trustless and transparent systems.
- **Career Opportunities**: Blockchain development is a high-demand field with growing opportunities.
- **Community and Ecosystem**: Ethereum’s vast ecosystem offers extensive libraries, tools, and support.

### Prerequisites

To get the most out of this tutorial, you should have:
- Basic understanding of programming (e.g., variables, functions, loops).
- Familiarity with JavaScript (helpful for tooling like Hardhat or Truffle).
- Knowledge of blockchain concepts (e.g., what a smart contract is).

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Tools You’ll Need

- **Node.js and npm**: For managing dependencies and running scripts.
- **Hardhat**: A development environment for compiling, testing, and deploying Solidity contracts.
- **MetaMask**: A browser extension for interacting with Ethereum networks.
- **VS Code**: A recommended code editor with Solidity extensions (e.g., Juan Blanco’s Solidity plugin).

### Installing Node.js and npm

1. Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
## Setting Up Hardhat
Create a new project directory and initialize it:
```
mkdir solidity-tutorial
cd solidity-tutorial
npm init -y
```
## Install Hardhat:
```
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```
## Set up a Hardhat project:
```
npx hardhat
```

# Solidity Basics
### Structure of a Solidity Contract
A Solidity contract is defined using the contract keyword. Here’s a simple example:
```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MyFirstContract {
    uint256 public myNumber;

    function setNumber(uint256 _number) public {
        myNumber = _number;
    }
}
```
SPDX-License-Identifier: Specifies the license (e.g., MIT).

pragma solidity: Defines the compiler version.

contract: The main building block, similar to a class in OOP.

## Variables and Data Types
Solidity supports several data types:
uint: Unsigned integer (e.g., uint256 for 256-bit numbers).

address: A 20-byte Ethereum address.

bool: True or false.

string: UTF-8 encoded string.

Example:
```
solidity
uint256 public count = 10;
address public owner = msg.sender;
bool public isActive = true;
string public name = "MyContract";
```
## Functions
Functions define the logic of your contract:
```
function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) public pure returns (uint256) {
    return a + b;
}
```
* public: Visibility modifier (anyone can call it).
* pure: Indicates the function doesn’t modify or read from the blockchain.
* returns: Specifies the return type.

## Modifiers
Modifiers are reusable code snippets to enforce conditions:
```
modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Not the owner");
    _;
}

function restrictedFunction() public onlyOwner {
    // Only the owner can call this
}
```
## Intermediate Concepts
### Mappings and Structs
* Mappings: Key-value stores, like dictionaries.
  ``` mapping(address => uint256) public balances;```
* Structs: Custom data structures.
```
  struct Voter {
    bool voted;
    uint256 vote;
}
mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
```
## Events
Events allow logging and communication with the frontend:
```
event Voted(address indexed voter, uint256 vote);

function vote(uint256 _vote) public {
    emit Voted(msg.sender, _vote);
}
```

## Inheritance
Contracts can inherit from others:
```
contract Base {
    uint256 public baseValue = 100;
}

contract Derived is Base {
    function getValue() public view returns (uint256) {
        return baseValue;
    }
}
```

# Advanced Solidity
## Gas Optimization
Gas is the fuel for Ethereum transactions. Optimize by:
Using uint256 instead of smaller types (e.g., uint8) due to EVM word size.

Minimizing storage usage (e.g., mapping over arrays when possible).

## Security Best Practices
* Reentrancy: Use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.
* Overflow/Underflow: Use Solidity ^0.8.0 for built-in checks.
* Access Control: Restrict functions with modifiers.

See [OpenZeppelin’s security guidelines](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/security) for more.

## Interacting with Other Contracts
Call another contract:
```
interface IExternalContract {
    function getData() external returns (uint256);
}

contract MyContract {
    function callExternal(address _contract) public returns (uint256) {
        return IExternalContract(_contract).getData();
    }
}
```

# Deploying to a Testnet
* Configure Hardhat for a testnet (e.g., Sepolia) in hardhat.config.js.
* Use a script to deploy:
  ```
  async function main() {
    const Voting = await ethers.getContractFactory("Voting");
    const voting = await Voting.deploy(["Alice", "Bob"]);
    await voting.deployed();
    console.log("Deployed to:", voting.address);
  }
  main();
  ```
* Fund your wallet with test ETH from a faucet and deploy using npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia.
